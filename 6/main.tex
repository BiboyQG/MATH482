\section*{Exercise 1}
An interval matrix $A \in \{0, 1\}^{m\times n}$ is such that all 1s in each row occur consecutively. Precisely this means that for all $1 \leq i \leq m$, if $a_{ij} = 1$ and $a_{ik} = 1$ with $j \leq k$, then $a_{ih} = 1$ for all $j \leq h \leq k$. Prove that interval matrices are totally unimodular. \\

\textit{Hint:} Recall that $\det(B) = \det(B')$ if $B'$ is obtained from $B$ by applying the column operation $C_i = C_i + kC_j$ where $j \neq i$. \\

\textbf{Solution:} \\

Let $B$ be any square submatrix of size $n \times n$ from the interval matrix $A$. Due to the interval property, in each row of $B$, the 1s occur consecutively. \\

For each row $i$ of $B$, let $j_i$ be the leftmost column such that $B_{i,j_i} = 1$. By the interval property, if $B_{i,j_i} = 1$ and $B_{i,k} = 1$ with $j_i < k$, then $B_{i,h} = 1$ for all $j_i \leq h \leq k$. \\

For each row $i$, for all columns $k > j_i$ where $B_{i,k} = 1$, we apply the column operation:
\begin{align*}
C_k = C_k - C_{j_i}
\end{align*}

This would replace all 1s in row $i$ (except the leftmost) with 0s. After performing this for all rows, we have a matrix $B'$ where each row has at most one 1. \\

For the determinant of $B'$: \\

Case 1: If $B'$ has a row with no 1s, then $\det(B') = 0$. \\

Case 2: If $B'$ has a column with no 1s, then $\det(B') = 0$. \\

Case 3: Otherwise, each row and each column of $B'$ contains exactly one 1. In this case, $B'$ is a permutation matrix, and the determinant of a permutation matrix is either 1 or -1, depending on the parity of the permutation. \\

Since column operations of the form $C_i = C_i + kC_j$ ($i \neq j$) preserve the determinant, we have:
\begin{align*}
\det(B) = \det(B') \in \{-1, 0, 1\}
\end{align*}

Therefore, every square submatrix of the interval matrix $A$ has determinant in $\{-1, 0, 1\}$, proving that interval matrices are totally unimodular.

\section*{Exercise 2}
Consider the bipartite graph with vertices $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{10}\}$ on one side, vertices $\{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{10}\}$ on the other side, and an edge between $a_i$ and $b_j$ if the product $ij$ is a multiple of 6. \\

Find a largest matching in this graph, and show that it cannot be any larger by finding a vertex cover of the same size. \\

\textbf{Solution:} \\

\section*{Exercise 3}
A bipartite graph $(X,Y,E)$ has $|X| = |Y| = n$ and is $r$-regular: every vertex (in $X$ or in $Y$) is the endpoint of exactly $r$ edges.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Determine $|E|$, the number of edges in the graph.
    \item[(b)] Show that any vertex cover must contain at least $n$ vertices.
    
    This implies that there is a matching of size $n$, which matches every vertex in $X$ to a vertex in $Y$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Solution:} \\

\section*{Exercise 4}
Find examples of networks with the following properties:

    \item[(c)] A network with multiple maximum flows and multiple minimum cuts.
\end{itemize}

For each example, describe the maximum flow(s) and the minimum cut(s). \\

\textbf{Solution:} \\
